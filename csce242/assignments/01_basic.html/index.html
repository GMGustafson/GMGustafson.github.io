    <h1> &#x266B; Country Music Festivals &#x266B;</h1>
    <h2> By: Grace Gustafson </h2>

    <p> Throughout the world, there are country festivals, both big and small, that showcase up-and-coming artists and feature well-known headliners who draw large crowds. Festival-goers often turn the event into a full-day experience, arriving early to tailgate in the parking lot, leisurely making their way into the concert grounds, and even spending months planning their attendance. For many artists, performing at a festival is a great way to engage with fans when they are not on tour, leaving the audience eager for more.</p>

    <p> Some notable country festivals from the past year include The Country Fest, which had Lainey Wilson, Thomas Rhett, and Cody Johnson as headliners, and StageCoach, featuring Luke Bryan, Kane Brown, and Chris Stapleton. In June 2023, the BareFoot Country festival in New Jersey included performances by Blake Shelton, Kid Rock, Darius Rucker, and Jon Pardi. These are just a few examples of the many country festivals that took place, highlighting the unique experience they offer compared to traditional concerts.</p>
